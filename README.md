# Learning GitHub & Data Science Basics

Hi! 👋  
This repository documents my learning journey in using GitHub,
Python programming, data analysis, and basic machine learning.

I created this repository as a beginner to practice:
- using GitHub properly
- organizing projects
- documenting learning progress
- building a simple technical portfolio

---

## 📂 Repository Structure


---

## 🐍 Python Basic
- Introduction to Python syntax
- Variables, data types, and basic operations
- Simple examples using Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Data Analysis Project
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using a real dataset
- Data overview, distribution analysis, and visualization
- Insights derived from basic statistical exploration

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Basics
This section contains simple regression models to understand
basic machine learning workflows:

- **Linear Regression** – baseline model
- **Random Forest Regression** – non-linear ensemble model
- **XGBoost Regression** – boosting-based model
- **Model Comparison** – performance comparison using MSE and R²

The goal is to understand:
- data preparation
- model training
- evaluation metrics
- prediction visualization

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus
- Python for data analysis
- Data visualization
- Basic machine learning concepts
- Writing clean and readable notebooks
- Using GitHub for project documentation

---

## 📘 Notes
This repository is part of my self-learning journey.
The projects are intentionally kept simple to focus on
fundamental understanding rather than complexity.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add more datasets
- Improve feature engineering
- Try classification models
- Enhance documentation and explanations
